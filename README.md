## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Senior Data Engineer driven by a deep curiosity for **scalable data systems** and **efficient ETL pipelines**. My journey so far:

- **Architected multi-layer database frameworks** and orchestrated **end-to-end data solutions** for large-scale institutional reporting.
- Transitioned legacy pipelines into **Apache Airflow**, slashing failure rates by **95%**.
- Optimized AWS Redshift ingestion, reducing monthly operational costs by **91%**—translating to **\$738K** in annual savings.
- Built internal Python packages to **speed up ETL project development by 50%**.
- Deployed real-time monitoring systems for FIX log flows, **cutting client complaints by 40%**.

When I’m not crafting resilient data infrastructures, you’ll find me exploring new AWS services, tinkering with open-source projects, and sharing what I learn with the community.
